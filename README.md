# UNT-CS-Machine-Learning-Project
This is the Machine Learning Project for Group 4 at UNT CS Machine Course Spring 2024

# Description of code:

1. classification.ipynb -  contains the code where we combined our three features to make a predcition using Logistic Regression
2. 3DimensionData.csv - Data needed to run classification.ipynb
3. project_ahmad - contains the Support Vector Model code and data needed to run the model
4. Project_andres - contains the Logistic Regression (main model) code and data needed to run the model
5. Project_Farhan - contains the Gaussian Naive Bayes model (data is downloaded from Kaggle after the code is run)
